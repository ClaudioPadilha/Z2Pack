pw2z2pack.x for QE 5.3.0

post-processing tool to compute the overlap matrix (.mmn file) for Z2pack (http://z2pack.ethz.ch/)
based on pw2wannier90.x


------------
INSTALLATION
------------

* copy the pw2z2pack.f90 in the ${QEDIR}/PP/src directory
* add these lines to the ${QEDIR}/PP/src/Makefile:
   
pw2z2pack.x : pw2z2pack.o libpp.a $(MODULES) $(LIBOBJS)
	$(LD) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ \
		pw2z2pack.o libpp.a $(MODULES) $(LIBOBJS) $(LIBS)
	- ( cd ../../bin ; ln -fs ../PP/src/$@ . )

* in the ${QEDIR}/PP/src/ directory run "make pw2z2pack.x"

-------------------
INPUT FILE
-------------------

Namelist: INPUTPP
  prefix	CHARATER
    prefix of files saved by program pw.x
         
  outdir	CHARACTER  
    directory containing the {prefix}.save directory saved by pw.x

  seedname	CHARACTER
    name of the overlap matrix file {seedname}.mmn

  isym		INTEGER
    symmetry which should be used to split the states in two symmetry subspace
    the number isym corresponds to the number of the symmetry given in pw.x standard output
    when using the option verbosity='high' 
    DEFAULT: 0 (.i.e. no symmetry is considered)

  sym_eig	COMPLEX
    eigenvalue of the symmetry operator isym 
    if isym!=0, the code only computes overlap for symmetry eigenstates with symmetry eigenvalue sym_eig  

  nexband	INTEGER
    number of lower bands to exclude from the overlap calculation

Example:

&inputpp
   prefix='job'
   outdir='./'
   seedname='job'
   isym=10
   sym_eig=(0.0d0,1.0d0)
   nexband=2
